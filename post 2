<p>WHO’s Immunization Information System (WIISE) team has been working to provide an end-to-end solution for data collection (eJRF), harmonization (WIISEMart) and data visualization. The result&nbsp; is the&nbsp;<a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO Immunization Data Portal</a>, which allows users to find, interact, visualize, download and share immunization data more easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>WHO Immunization Data Portal&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Portal is WHO’s main hub for immunization- related data, showcasing global, regional, and country trends across key&nbsp; immunization performance indicators such as vaccination coverage and total numbers in reported cases of vaccine-preventable disease (VPD). This data helps monitor improvements and identify gaps in program evaluation. Data is reported through the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/immunization-analysis-and-insights/global-monitoring/who-unicef-joint-reporting-process" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization (JRF)</a>&nbsp;each year, and updated on the portal as country data is reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How does the Immunization Data Portal work?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Portal contains three sections that allows users to filter the information needed, compare datasets and download detailed data by topic. The immunization topics available show data for different country groups including WHO and UNICEF regions and World Bank Income Status. This short explanatory video demonstrates how to make the best use of this vital tool:</p>

<p><strong>What type of of information is available?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Data sets can be visualized and downloaded fully or by various country groupings. Data topics available on the portal include immunization topics such as: vaccine-preventable disease reported cases and incidence, vaccination coverage, immunization program indicators, vaccine introductions, and vaccine schedules. On the Portal, you&nbsp; can compare data between reported cases and vaccination coverage numbers, visualize and analyse data over time, view charts and maps of the data, and export the data and visuals needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Portal also provides easy access to other immunization- related data and analytics such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/immunization-analysis-and-insights/global-monitoring/immunization-coverage/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO and UNICEF’s Estimates of National Immunization Coverage</a>&nbsp;(WUENIC), PDF country files and summary presentations, subnational immunization coverage data, and the COVID-19 Immunization Dashboard.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
