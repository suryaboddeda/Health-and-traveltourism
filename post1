<p>The WHO Director-General transmits the report of the third meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) Emergency Committee regarding the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox, held on Thursday, 20 October 2022, from 12:00 to 17:00 CEST.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Emergency Committee acknowledged that some progress has been made in the global response to the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox since the last meeting, including the emerging information on the effectiveness of behavioural interventions and vaccines. The Committee held the consensus view that the event continues to meet the IHR criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and highlights the primary reasons for ongoing concern. These include ongoing&nbsp;transmission in some regions, continuing preparedness and response inequity within and between WHO Member States, an emerging potential for greater health impact in vulnerable populations, continuing risk of stigma and discrimination, weak health systems in some developing countries leading to under-reporting, ongoing lack of equitable access to diagnostics, antiviral and vaccines, and research gaps needing to be addressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The WHO Director-General expresses&nbsp;his gratitude to the Chair,&nbsp;Members, and Advisors for their advice and concurs with this advice that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC for the reasons detailed in the proceedings of the meeting below. The Director-General issues revised Temporary Recommendations in relation to this PHEIC, which are presented at the end of this document.</p>

<p><strong>Proceedings of the third meeting</strong><strong>&nbsp;of the IHR Emergency Committee</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox was convened by videoconference, with the Chair and Vice-Chair being present in person on the premises of WHO headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland. Members and Advisors joined by videoconference. Eleven of the 15 Members and 6 of the 9 Advisors to the Committee participated in the meeting. The WHO Director-General, in his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-3rd-meeting-of-the-ihr-emergency-committee--multi-country-outbreak-of-monkeypox---20-october-2022">opening remarks</a>, welcomed the Committee, noting a promising decline in cases globally, although progress in the regions of the Americas and Africa is less certain, where cases are rising in some countries, and underreporting is likely in others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel reminded the Members and Advisors of their roles and responsibilities and the mandate of the Emergency Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics also reminded Members and Advisors of their roles and responsibilities, including their duty of confidentiality as to the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee; as well as of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or direct conflict of interest. Each Member and Advisor who was&nbsp;present was surveyed. No conflicts of interest were noted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was noted that one Member has withdrawn from the Committee on account of other commitments&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meeting was handed over to the Chair of the Emergency Committee, Dr Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, who introduced the objectives of the meeting: to provide views to the WHO Director-General as to whether the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox continues to constitute&nbsp;a PHEIC, and, if so,&nbsp;to review the proposed temporary recommendations to States Parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Presentations</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Representatives of Brazil, Ghana, and Sudan updated the Committee on the epidemiological situation in their countries and their current response efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The WHO Secretariat updated the Committee on the global epidemiological situation as well as on the rapidly evolving knowledge in understanding the clinical manifestation and evolution of the disease. Details can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---19-october-2022">weekly epidemiological update</a>&nbsp;and in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-outbreak-of-monkeypox--external-situation-report--8---19-october-2022">8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;External situation report</a>; WHO updates the information regularly through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situation-reports"></a><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situation-reports">external situation reports</a>. All data are also available and case counts are updated daily at this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/">2022 Monkeypox Outbreak: Global Trends (shinyapps.io)</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Secretariat noted that, since the determination of the PHEIC on 23 July 2022, many more countries have promptly responded to the outbreak with a range of public health interventions and cases are declining globally. Nonetheless, the picture is mixed and, overall, the risk assessment conducted by the WHO Secretariat concludes that as of 18 October 2022 the public health risk remains moderate globally; at regional level, risk was assessed as high in the WHO region of the Americas, declining from high to moderate in the European region, remaining moderate for the WHO Regions of Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asia, and remaining low in the Western Pacific Region.</p>

<p>The Secretariat presented its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/monkeypox-strategic-preparedness--readiness--and-response-plan-(sprp)">Strategic preparedness, readiness and response plan for monkeypox 2022</a>, and the global funding appeal recently published. With a goal of stopping the global monkeypox outbreak, the plan articulates three objectives: to stop human-to-human transmission, protect the vulnerable, and minimize zoonotic transmission.&nbsp; Five core components underpin the global response: emergency coordination, collaborative surveillance, community protection, safe and scalable care, and countermeasures and research.</p>

<p>After the presentations, Committee Members and Advisors proceeded to engage the Secretariat and the presenting countries in a question-and-answer session.</p>

<p><strong>Deliberative session</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Committee reconvened in a closed meeting to examine the questions in relation to whether the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, and if so, to consider the proposed Temporary Recommendations, drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Chair reminded the Committee Members and Advisors of the definition of a PHEIC under the IHR: an extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through international spread, and which potentially requires a coordinated international response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Committee noted with concern that data from low-income settings are largely lacking, with scanty information available to determine whether transmission observed in Africa is mainly zoonotic or to determine the role of human-to-human transmission, including through intimate or sexual contact. Many low-income settings have inadequate diagnostic capacity and do not yet have access to vaccines or therapeutics, despite clearly having the highest reported case fatality of all regions, and little information is available as to whether authorities are considering their use or requesting supplies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Committee noted that in high-income settings in which the outbreak was first experienced, preliminary information suggests significant declines in the number of newly reported cases of monkeypox. Data needed to determine the respective contributions of various factors to these declines have yet to be fully collected and analysed. These factors could include: the adoption of safer sexual behaviours among populations at higher risk; the seasonal reduction of large gatherings enhancing risk-taking sexual behaviours; the strong vaccine acceptance in affected communities and rising rates of pre- and post-exposure vaccination; possibly rising immunity following infection among populations at higher risk; and surveillance artifacts resulting from declining patient presentation and testing for less severe cases. While evaluation and research have established that lower participation in higher-risk activities has contributed to slowing the outbreak, the Committee expressed concerns about the sustainability of these trends, early signals of vaccine hesitancy in a few areas within an overall context of very high vaccine acceptance; and an increasing concentration of cases amongst minoritized communities. The Committee noted the need to gather evidence on the drivers and interventions that have led to positive behaviour change.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Committee noted the epidemiological concomitance of monkeypox, HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections, and expressed concern about the more frequent severe outcomes and deaths in people living with HIV who are immunocompromised and/or not receiving antiretroviral treatment, especially in underserved and low resource settings</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Committee expressed deep concern over continuing and emerging inequities in the response to the outbreak and noted the imperative for mechanisms, commitments and actions that will ensure equity in access to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. In addition, the Committee called for respect for human rights for all, including those in marginalized communities vulnerable to stigma; some Members reiterated their views that laws, policies and practices by state or non-state actors that criminalize or stigmatize consensual same-sex behaviour may hamper response interventions. It was advised that public health best practices include a harm reduction approach with efforts to overcome barriers caused by policies and laws which criminalize homosexuality or otherwise contribute to stigma and discrimination and impede efforts to control the outbreak. It was also recommended that global and national programmes should continue to engage with affected communities, work towards 1) integrating monkeypox outbreak response with HIV prevention and sexual health services where appropriate and 2) continue to strive for greater strategic support and research for most-affected countries.</p>
